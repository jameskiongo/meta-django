post: send data and create record
put: update whole record
patch: update partial record
delete: delete whole resource
http request:
version type
url
method 
request headers
body(optional)
http request headers: extra information for server to make decision on how
to present the content
RESTFULNESS
rest apis-provides easy way to communicate with server
restful api
a. must have client server
b. stateless
c. cachable: responses can be saved
d. layered
e. uniform interface
API NAMING CONVENTIONS
Endpoints/uri/url should always use lowercase letters and hyphens in between
words
API with variables you should use camelCase to represent the id eg orderId and 
wrap them in curly braces eg: /orders/{orderId}/menu-item
forward slash : indicate hierarchical relationship
customer - orders - ordersitem
/customer/{orderId}/order-item
always use a nouns, No verbs
never use filename extension eg customer/{customerId}.json
instead use: customer/{customerId}?format=json
to filter a result use query string parameters eg /menu-item?category=apetizer
never add a trail slash at the end of endpoint eg /sports/basketball/teams/
remove the final slash eg /sports/basketball/teams
    TOOLS FOR API DEVELOPMENT
1. Curl - make http calls from command line
a. GET request eg
curl https://postman-echo.com/get?project=littlelemon
b. POST request eg
curl -d "project=littlelemon" -X POST
https://postman-echo/post
2. Insomnia Rest client- store, organize, and execute REST API requests
3. Postman
    REST BEST PRACTICES
KISS- keep it simple stupid
Filter, order and paginate
Versioning
Caching
Rate limiting: prevent abuse to api(limits calls)
Response time
Monitor status codes
    Security and authentication in REST Api
How to keep API safe:
a. SSL(secure socket layer) certificates
b. Signed URLS: limited access for a period of time
   Developers use HMAC
c. Token-based authentication: JSON Web Token(JWT)
d. cross-origin resource sharing(CORS policy and firewalls)
e. Firewalls application on your server
    Access Control
Role: collection of privileges
privileges: allowed to do a task
